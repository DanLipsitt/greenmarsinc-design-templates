# Title

*You don't need to use all of the sections in this template, or put them in the same order. But check all of them to see if they need to be addressed.*

## Glossary

*Define or link to problem-domain terms that may not be familiar to developers.*

## Overview

*Describe motivation/business case.*

## Customer Requirement Specifications

*Link to or describe customer requirements.*

## Third-party Documentation

*Link to documentation for protocols, schemas, standards, tools, or libraries that are relevant.*

## User Stories

*Describe use cases in narrative form. Cover the actions that users (whether they are end users or API clients) need to be able to perform. Describe them in a way that a QA technician could validate them without understanding the code.*

## Domain Objects

*What are the datatypes? What behaviors do they support? Which objects interact?*

## Data Flow/Interaction Sequence

*Give a temporal view of program behavior. How does data flow through the system?*

## Concurrency and Interactivity

*Are there processes that happen concurrently or asynchronously? Are there resulting race conditions? Is locking required?*

## Performance and Load

*Are there performance requirements? Characterize the volume or rate of inputs, outputs, and storage if relevant. Are any of the components especially CPU, memory, storage, or network intensive? Is load likely to be spiky? What is the desired behavior if capacity is exceeded? Is load testing required?*

## Security

*Describe any security concerns related to this system. Are there any new attack surfaces introduced? How are they secured? How is access controlled?*

## Prior Art

*Describe any significant third-party systems and components that you are using or have considered and rejected. How do they meet our needs (or not)?*

 - *Off the shelf components*
 - *Systems with similar designs*

*Sometimes library docs link to preferred third-party packages for missing functionality. If we need that functionality, it's especially good to check out these recommended packages and mention why they don't fit requirements if we decide not to use them.*

## System Architecture

*Describe supporting infrastructure needs. What server resources will be required?*

### Deployment

## Connected Systems

*What other parts of the application or third-party systems  does this one connect to?*

### System List

*List systems that provide input to or take input from this system. If they have design docs, provide links.*

### Interfaces

*Describe HTTP or code APIs that will be used to interact with this design.*

## Acceptance Tests

*Describe specific test protocols that are not covered in other sections such as [User Stories](#user-stories)* or [Customer Requirement Specifications](customer-requirement-specifications).

## UX/UI

*If necessary, describe user interface interactions and affordances.*

## Open Questions

*What still needs to be decided or described?*
