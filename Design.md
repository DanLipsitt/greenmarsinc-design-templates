# Title

*You don't need to use all of the sections in this template, or put them in the same order. But check all of them to see if they need to be addressed.*

## Glossary

*Define or link to problem-domain terms that may not be familiar to developers.*

## Overview

*Describe motivation/business case.*

## Customer Requirement Specifications

*Link to or describe customer requirements.*

## User Stories

*Describe use cases in narrative form. Cover the actions that users (whether they are end users or API clients) need to be able to perform. Describe them in a way that a QA technician could validate them without understanding the code.*

## Third-party Documentation

*Link to documentation for protocols, schemas, standards, tools, or libraries that are relevant.*

## Performance and Load

*Are there performance requirements? Characterize the volume or rate of inputs, outputs, and storage if relevant. Are any of the components especially CPU, memory, storage, or network intensive? Is load likely to be spiky? What is the desired behavior if capacity is exceeded? Is load testing required?*

## Concurrency and Interactivity

*Are there processes that happen concurrently or asynchronously? Are there resulting race conditions? Is locking required?*

## Security

*Describe any security concerns related to this system. Are there any new attack surfaces introduced? How are they secured? How is access controlled?*

## Prior Art

*Describe any significant third-party systems and components that you are using or have considered and rejected. How do they meet our needs (or not)?*

 - *Off the shelf components*
 - *Systems with similar designs*

## System Architecture

*Describe supporting infrastructure needs. What server resources will be required?*

### Deployment

## Connected Systems

### System List

*List systems that provide input to or take input from this system. If they have design docs, provide links.*

### Interfaces

*Describe HTTP or code APIs that will be used to interact with this design.*

## Acceptance Tests

*Describe specific test protocols that are not covered in other sections such as [User Stories](#user-stories)* or [Customer Requirement Specifications](customer-requirement-specifications).

## UI

## Open Questions

*What still needs to be decided or described?*
